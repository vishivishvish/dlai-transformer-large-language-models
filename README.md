## ***1 - Introduction***

- In this course, we will learn about the main components of the LLM Transformer architecture.
- The Transformer architecture was, of course, introduced in the 2017 paper - Attention is All You Need, originally for Machine Translation tasks (for ex: English input to German output).
- But this same architecture turned out to be great for inputting a prompt (like an instruction) and outputting a response to that prompt / instruction, like a Q&A. 
- The original Transformer architecture consisted of 2 parts - an Encoder and a Decoder.
