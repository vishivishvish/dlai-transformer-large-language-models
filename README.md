## Notebook 1: Text-to-SQL
**Notebook:** text_to_sql.ipynb

**Description:** This notebook uses OSSS Large Language Models (and fine-tunes) to convert Natural Language Text to SQL commands - a business use-cases with important value for organizations that could assist developers and non-coder managers alike in providing SQL commands that can convert language instructions to actual SQL queries that can run on a database. Ideally, we would like to go straight from Natural Language to SQLite, but at the time of creating this notebook, there is no mechanism to do this directly with LLMs in the sub 14B parameter range that can directly fit into the T4 GPU of Google Colab's free tier. So a combination of two LLMs being used one-by-one is employed - we use the SQLCoder 2 7B LLM from Defog AI to convert Natural Language commands into PostgreSQL, and then use Meta's Code Llama 13B Instruct to translate PostgreSQL queries into SQLite. These generated SQLite commands are then run in a SQLite database we create in this Colab environment, and as we can see, they do actually work and give us the results we would expect if we were to directly write SQLite commands for this database.
